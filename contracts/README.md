# RMRK EVM implementation examples

This section contains the examples of using RMRK legos to build your own smart contracts. Every example uses the `@rmrk-team/evm-contracts` dependency in order to implement the examples. Adding it allows you to easily include them in yout own smart contracts.

The examples covered are:

1. [Nesting](./Nesting/README.md) examines the Nesting RMRK lego.
2. [MultiResource](./MultiResource/README.md) examines the MultiResource RMRK lego.
3. [NestingMultiResource](./NestingMultiResource/) examines the Nesting and MultiResource RMRK legos operating together.
4. [MegredEquippable](./MergedEquippable/README.md) examines the Merged equippable RMRK lego formation.
