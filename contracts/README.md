# RMRK EVM implementation examples

This section contains the examples of using RMRK legos to build your own smart contracts. Every example uses the
`@rmrk-team/evm-contracts` dependency in order to implement the examples. Adding it allows you to easily include them in
your own smart contracts.

The examples included are:

1. [Nestable](./Nestable/README.md) examines the Nestable RMRK lego.
2. [MultiAsset](./MultiAsset/README.md) examines the MultiAsset RMRK lego.
3. [NestableMultiAsset](./NestableMultiAsset/) examines the Nestable and MultiAsset RMRK legos operating together.
4. [MegredEquippable](./MergedEquippable/README.md) examines the Merged equippable RMRK lego composite.
5. [SplitEquippable](./SplitEquippable/README.md) examines the Split equippable RMRK lego composite.

**NOTE: This is a living collection of examples, which will get updated as the RMRK EVM implementation evolves.**
